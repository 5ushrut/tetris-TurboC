# Tetris in C – Computer Graphics Diploma Project

 **About**

This project is a **console-based Tetris game** written in C, created as part of my diploma studies in Computer Graphics. It was developed using **Turbo C** on Windows and is intended as a learning exercise focused on basic graphics and game logic.

---

 **Requirements**

- **Turbo C** (essential—must use Turbo C/TC++ compiler, not modern GCC/Clang)
- **Windows** (Turbo C does not run on Linux/macOS)

---

 **How to Compile & Run**

1. **Open Turbo C** on your computer.
2. **Load** the file `tetris.c` in Turbo C.
3. **Compile** using `Alt + F9`.
4. **Run** the game using `Ctrl + F9`.

 **Controls**

- **Left Arrow / A** – Move left
- **Right Arrow / D** – Move right
- **Down Arrow / S** – Drop piece faster
- **Up Arrow / W** – Rotate piece
- **Q** – Quit game

---

 **Project Context**

This project was created for my **Computer Graphics diploma subject**, using **Turbo C** to demonstrate basic game mechanics and simple terminal graphics. It is specifically tailored for Turbo C and may not compile or run with modern compilers or IDEs.

 **How to Contribute or Fork**

If you want to try the project or experiment, **please use Turbo C**. For other C compilers, significant code adaptation may be needed.  
Feel free to fork, study, or discuss the code—just remember: **Turbo C required**.
